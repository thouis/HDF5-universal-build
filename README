This script builds a universal (i386, ppc, x86_64) version of the HDF5
libraries and include files for Mac OS X.  It does do by running three
separate build and install steps, then using lipo to combine the
libraries and executables, and wrapping the header files in
architecture-detecting #ifdefs.  I haven't tested it beyond using it
to build h5py and testing its builtin tests on each architecture, and
then using it to run the CellProfiler unit tests, many of which rely
on h5py.
